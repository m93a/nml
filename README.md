# nml
Namespace Markup Language

## Work in progress!
This spec is not finished yet! For more info about nml, you can check out my [parser](https://github.com/m93a/nml-parser/).

## Intro

### What's nml?
The Namespace Markup Language (`nml`) is a try to create more powerful and user-friendly version of The Extensible Markup Language, aka. `xml`. It's name is a creation of [Phil Andy](https://github.com/philandy), originally thought to be a name of a community-maintaned version of `html` (see [this thread](https://github.com/OscarGodson/HTML6/issues/17#issuecomment-21987975) for more info).

### What's wrong with xml?
Are you a big fan of `xml`? Me too. "But - wait!" you say, "Then why are you trying to get rid of it?". I am not. `nml` will probably never replace `xml`. And it's not its goal. `nml` can be easily converted to `xml` at any time.
The problem with `xml` is that it's easy-to-read for parsers but hard-to-write for programmers. Why nobody uses `xhtml`? Because they would lose those comfortable features like boolean attributes, unquoted values and UPPERCASE TAG NAMES (yes, some people still use them). The goal of `nml` is to be as comfortable as possible without losing nothing of `xml` readability.

### What language is nml's default for defining namespaces?
Huh, that's a good point. Actually - I don't know. Personally I'd like to use something based on `css` syntax but there are many, many possibilities and it's better to let the community decide.

### Who is this spec for?
This spec is intended to be suitable for everybody, either a beginner or an expert writing his own nml-based browser-or-something. You will find four types of content here - normative sections for parser-makers, advanced sections for users that know `xml` and `html` and beginner sections for - wait for it... - beginners! The fourth type is an example section for better understanding. Note that the advanced sections may be omitted on places without any difference from `xml` and `html`.

## The Spec Itself

### Document
**Beginner section**  
Basically, any file written in `nml` is a _document_. Document is set of everything in your file. The building units of the document are _tags_ and _text_.

**Example**
```html
<library>
 <book id=1 >The Little Prince</book>
 <book id=2 >The Universe Versus Alex Woods</book>
 <book id=42>The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy</book>
</library>
```

### Tag
**Beginner section**  
Tags are used to structure the document. Tag is a part of document between `<` and `>` characters.  
There are three types of tags:
 * Single tag
 * Begin tag
 * End tag

Begin tag looks like this: `<name>`. It marks the beginning of the `name` _element_.  
End tag is similar to begin tag but it has a slash at the beginning: `</name>`. It marks the end of the `name` _element_.  
Single tag is a combination of begin and end tags. It looks like this: `<name />` and means the same as this: `<name></name>`, it creates an _empty element_.

What does _element_ mean? Elements are virtual parts of the document. Elements may have child elements. But don't have to.

Single and begin tags can have _attributes_ to keep some information. They're based on a simple `foo=bar` format, written
right after the element name (and a space). In this examle, `foo` is called _attribute name_ or _key_ and `bar` is an
_attribute value_. If you want to use whitespace characters in value, you have to quote it this way: `foo="some bars"`.

There are also _single attributes_, created by omitting the value and equal sign. Eg. attribute `bool` means `bool=""` (value is empty).

**Example**  
`<abc>` - Begin tag of an `abc` element.  
`</foobar>` - End tag of a `foobar` element.  
`<name first=Joe middle=Patata last=Rodriguez />` - Single tag of a `name` element with three attributes.  
`<a>Hi there!</a>` - A text between two tags, making one `a` element together.  
`<x><foo /></x>` - The `foo` element is a child of the `x` element.  
`<hello world />` - Element `hello` with a single attribute `world`.  
`<warning catch=attribute/>` - **Begin tag** (!) - that's because the slash is a part of attribute value.  
`<warning catch=attribute />` - Single tag, attribute value and the slash are divided by a space.  

**Advanced section**  
Single elements are interpreted the same way as in xml.  
Attributes are interpreted the same way in html5 (unquoted and single attributes are allowed).

Characters allowed in attribute and tag names (and rule):
 * all the characters
 * not a controll character (0 - 1F, 7F - 9F)
 * not a surrogate character (D800 - DFFF)
 * not a special character in range FFF0 - FFFB and FFFE - FFFF
 * not a whitespace character (9, A, D, 20)

**Normative section**  
//TODO  
Tagname in regex: `[A-Za-z0-9](?[\N{U+0030}-\N{U+0039}\N{U+0040}-\N{U+007E}\N{U+00A1}-\N{U+D7FF}\N{U+E000}-\N{U+FFE9}\N{U+FFFC}\N{U+FFFD}])*(\s*:\s*<[A-Za-z0-9](?[\N{U+0021}-\N{U+0039}\N{U+0040}-\N{U+007E}\N{U+00A1}-\N{U+D7FF}\N{U+E000}-\N{U+FFE9}\N{U+FFFC}\N{U+FFFD}])*)?`
